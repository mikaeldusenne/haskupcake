# Haskupcake

Haskupcake is a [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) library to build and send requests to the [PIC-SURE](http://bd2k-picsure.hms.harvard.edu/) API.

it's name is strongly influenced by the [Rcupcake](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Rcupcake) library, since they both accomplish the same goal.

## Installation

The use of [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) is recommended.

### Clone the repo

```sh
git https://github.com/mikaunix/haskupcake
cd haskupcake
```

### Install the library

```sh
stack setup
stack install
```

`stack setup` will automatically download the ghc compiler if you don't have it. `stack install` will install the pandoc executable into ~/.local/bin, which you should add to your PATH.

## Usage

```haskell
import 
```
